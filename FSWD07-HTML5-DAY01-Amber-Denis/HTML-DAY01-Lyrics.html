			<p><span>As he came into the window<br>
			   It was the sound of a crescendo<br>
			   He came into her apartment<br>
			   He left the bloodstains on the carpet<br>
			   She ran underneath the table<br>
			   He could see she was unable<br>
			   So she ran into the bedroom<br>
			   She was struck down, it was her doom</span></p>

			<p><span>Annie, are you ok?<br>
					 So, Annie are you ok<br>
					 Are you ok, Annie<br>
					 Annie, are you ok?<br>
					 So, Annie are you ok<br>
					 Are you ok, Annie<br>
					 Annie, are you ok?<br>
					 So, Annie are you ok?<br>
					 Are you ok, Annie?<br>
					 Annie, are you ok?<br>
					 So, Annie are you ok,<br>are you ok Annie?</span></p>


			<p><span>Annie, are you ok?<br>
					 So, Annie are you ok?<br>
					 Are you ok, Annie?<br>
					 Annie, are you ok?<br>
					 So, Annie are you ok?<br>
					 Are you ok, Annie?<br>
					 Annie, are you ok?<br>
					 So, Annie are you ok?<br>
					 Are you ok, Annie?<br>
					 You've been hit by<br>
					 You've been hit by<br>
					 A smooth criminal</span></p>

			<p><span>So they came into the outway<br>
					 It was Sunday - what a black day<br>
					 Mouth to mouth<br>
					 Resuscitation<br>
					 Sounding heartbeats - intimidation</span></p>

			<p><span>Annie, are you ok?
					 So, Annie are you ok<br>
					 Are you ok, Annie<br>
					 Annie, are you ok?<br>
					 So, Annie are you ok<br>
					 Are you ok, Annie<br>
					 Annie, are you ok?<br>
					 So, Annie are you ok?<br>
					 Are you ok, Annie?<br>
					 Annie, are you ok?<br>
					 So, Annie are you ok, are you ok Annie?</span></p>

			<p><span>(Then you Ran into the bedroom)<br>
					 (You were struck down)<br>
					 (It was your doom)</span></p>

			<p><span>(You've been struck by<br>
						A smooth criminal)</span></p>

			<p><span>Okay, I want everybody to clear<br>
					 The area right now!</span></p>

			<p><span>Aaow!
					 (Annie are you ok?)<br>
					   I don't know!<br>
					 (Will you tell us that you're ok?)<br>
					   I don't know!<br>
					 (There's a sign in the window)<br>
					  I don't know!<br>
					 (That he struck you - a crescendo Annie)<br>
					  I don't know!<br>
					 (He came into your apartment)<br>
					  I don't know!<br>
					 (Left the bloodstains on the carpet)<br>
					  I don't know why baby!<br>
					 (Then you ran into the bedroom)<br>
					  I don't know<br>
					 (You were struck down)<br>
					(It was your doom - Annie!)</span></p>

			<p><span> Dag gone it - baby!<br>
					 (Will you tell us that you're ok?)<br>
					  Dag gone it - baby!<br>
					 (There's a sign in the window)<br>
					  Dag gone it - baby!<br>
					 (That he struck you - a crescendo Annie)<br>
					  Hoo! Hoo!<br>
					 (He came into your apartment)<br>
					  Dag gone it!<br>
					 (Left the bloodstains on the carpet)<br>
					  Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!<br>
					 (Then you ran into the bedroom)<br>
					  Dag gone it!</span></p>
