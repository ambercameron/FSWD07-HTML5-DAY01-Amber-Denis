<h1>Songbird</h1>
<h2>Fleetwood Mac</h2>
<p>
	<span>For you,</span> 
	<span>there'll be no more crying.</span>
    <br>
	<span>For you,</span>
	<span>the sun will be shining.</span>
   <br>
    <span>And I feel that when I'm with you</span>
    <span>It's alright,</span>
    <br>
    <span>I know it's right</span>
    
</p>


<p>
	<span>To you,</span>
    <span>I'll give the world</span>
	<br><span>To you,</span> 
    <span>I'll never be cold.</span>
    <br>
    <span>'Cause I feel that when I'm with you,</span>
    <br>
<span>It's alright,</span>
<span>I know it's right.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<div>And the songbirds are singing like they know the score</div>
    <span>And I love you, I love you, I love you like never before</span>
</p>

<p>
	<div>And I wish you all the love in the world</div>
    <span>But most of all,</span>
    <span>I wish it from myself</span>
</p>

<p>
	<div>And the songbirds are singing like they know the score</div>
    <span>And I love you, I love you, I love you like never before</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Like never before,</span>
    <span>like never before,</span>
    <span>like never before.</span>
