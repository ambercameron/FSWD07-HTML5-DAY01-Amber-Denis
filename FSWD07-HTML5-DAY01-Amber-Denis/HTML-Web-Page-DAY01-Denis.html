																	<!-- Paragraph (About)-->

							<p><b>Fearless, also known as Huo Yuanjia (in Chinese)and as Jet Li's Fearless in the United Kingdom and in the United States, is a 2006 Chinese-Hong Kong martial arts film directed by Ronny Yu and starring Jet Li.</b></p>

							<p><b>It is loosely based on the life of Huo Yuanjia, a Chinese martial artist who challenged foreign fighters in highly publicized events, restoring pride and nationalism to China at a time when Western imperialism and Japanese manipulation were eroding the country in the final years of the Qing Dynasty before the birth of the Republic of China.</b></p>

							<p><b>Li stated in an interview that the film was his last wushu martial arts epic, a point also made in the film's television promotions and other publicity.</b></p>

							<p><b>The movie begins with Huo Yuanjia fighting and defeating three Westerners: a British boxer, a Belgian lancer, and a Spanish fencer.<br> While waiting for the fourth match to begin, Huo remembers his father Huo Endi teaching martial arts.</b></p>

							<p><b>The story is then told in an extended flashback.</b></p>

							<p><b>Watching his father fight, the young Yuanjia wants to participate, but his father is concerned about his asthma.</b></p>

							<p><b>Yuanjia sees his father in a match with Zhao, who dishonorably won by retaliating when Huo Endi held back a fatal blow.</b></p>

							<p><b>Humiliated by his father's defeat, Huo Yuanjia vows to regain the Huo family's honor and pride.</b></p>

							<p><b>He practices martial arts behind his father's back. As time goes by, Huo Yuanjia defeats several opponents (including Zhao's son)<br> and becomes a famous martial artist in Tianjin.</b></p>

							<p><b>As he becomes successful, he grows arrogant and ruthless towards his opponents, unlike his late father who advocated showing mercy to opponents.</b></p>

							<p><b>This also leads to Huo gaining many followers and getting himself into financial trouble by spending his family's money on drinking and partying.</b></p>
